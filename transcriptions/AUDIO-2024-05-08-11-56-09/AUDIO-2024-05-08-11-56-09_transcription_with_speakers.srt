4
0:00:10 --> 0:00:14
SPEAKER_01:  Yeah, I only want to ask if you will be needing a $2 billion.

5
0:00:14 --> 0:00:18
SPEAKER_01:  Because I have access to cash at the moment.

6
0:00:18 --> 0:00:25

7
0:00:25 --> 0:00:31
SPEAKER_01:  Okay, if that should be the case, can a trillion dollars make sense?

8
